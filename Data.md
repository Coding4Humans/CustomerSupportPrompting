## The Data
All names, emails and requests are synthesized with GPT-3.5 to use in the experiment.
The data was sent to the LLMs without any markdown formatting when submitted to be catagorized. It is in a spreadsheet here for readability.

## Claude-Instant 100k Response
Claude-Instant 100k also performed as quickly as Claude-Instant and GPT 3.5. 
On the initial prompt it provided a mis-formatted JSON style reply

![Claude-instant-100k mis-formatting](https://github.com/Coding4Humans/CustomerSupportPrompting/assets/36489846/0db42e3b-299a-4413-9498-9d09bc684fcb)

## Comparison
GPT 3.5, Claude-instant,and Claude-2-100k all generated their responses in JSON with no aditional formatting.
Claude-instant-100k and Claude-2-100k did add "assistant' style comments to the beginning of their reply. 
Claude-instant-100k had a weird mis-formatting issue that was resolved by pasting the data again.
GPT 4 formatted everything in explicite JSON formatting and this may be fine if used from the API but to copy/paste from the web app took an extra minute to correct.

This can all be remedied with more explicite instructions or access to the API.
